Nowadays you can program pretty much any electronic device, from computers, to cars, to sattelites, to your fridge. How do you know where to start? </p>\n<p>One good way to understand which first programming language to learn, is to look at the <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-popular-technologies\">StackOverflow Developer Survey from 2019</a>, where ~<strong>90000</strong> developers have expressed their opinion on technologies and other parts of the programming world.</p>\n<p>As you already see, at the top we have JavaScript, HTML and CSS. These languages are responsible for the explosive growth of web technologies we utilize every day. These 3 languages are going to be the main focus of this course.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you build a program?</strong> You write code for it. </p>\n<p><strong>Where?</strong> In any text editor or a specialized code editing environment (read - fancy text editor).</p>\n<p><strong>How?</strong> By writing in a special way, according to the rules of the language.</p>\n<p>The same way that humans understand language, like when it's spoken cleary, in properly structured sentences - in that same way computers understand what you're trying to do if you align to the way code should be written.</p>\n<p>Let's take a look at some HTML.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>h1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>I am a heading.<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>If you would give that to a web browser, you would see this (press the \"Result\" tab below):</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"200\" src=\"//jsfiddle.net/itshazy/aw5q8x6c/3/embedded/html,result/dark/\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowpaymentrequest frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<p>Simple enough right? You can press \"Edit in JSFiddle\" in the corner, to play around with the text. Try it out!</p>\n<p>Let's break it down.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>h1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>h1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>These HTML tags are for the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements\">\"section heading 1\"</a>, theres an opening and a closing one in the above examples. Inbetween you can place text and have it shown according to how \"section heading 1\" looks. By default, its the Times New Roman font with a large font size and some space underneath, to symbolize a heading, like one seen in a newspaper.</p>\n<p>For context, here are all of the heading sizes:</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" src=\"//jsfiddle.net/itshazy/2tvqn4r5/embedded/html,result/dark/\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowpaymentrequest frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n<h1>Executing it to Accomplish a Specific Result</h1>\n<p>Obviously the previous example is simple. Let's imagine you have written your program, even if it's just the above code.</p>\n<p>How to execute it? Let's imagine you have written your program and you want to execute it (read - launch it like a rocket ðŸš€). </p>\n<p>Since you've written it in HTML, you need a browser to actually execute the code. All of the browsers can read and execute HTML. We'll do exactly that in the next post.</p>\n<p>What about the \"Specific Result\" part? I am glad that whoever wrote that, did it like this, because a program should always be made for a specific purpose. Huge programs, like video games or social networks aren't single \"programs\", they're a collection of countless smaller programs, where each one of those (hopefully) is written for a specific purpose. </p>\n<p>So while it's relatively easy to learn how to build simple programs, connecting them in a way that builds upon each other and doesn't slow each other down is the essence of the craft.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What is Programming?"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/The Basics/2020-02-22-what-is-programming/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
