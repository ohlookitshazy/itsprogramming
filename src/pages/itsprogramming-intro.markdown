Welcome to the new ItsProgramming! I've switched to an entirely different setup for the website. I went from using Wordpress to using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a Static Website Generator and [GitHub](https://www.github.com) for hosting. 

## Why?

  Because this way, it's possible for anyone who knows their way around GitHub, can participate in adding to this project.

  I am personally very excited for what this choice will lead to and I hope that the world will gain value from such a resource of learning how to be practical, and be able to participate in the programming ecosystem.

## So what is this all about?

This is a project that i've wanted to create for a very long time now. This is a way of me paying forward. More precisely, this is a way of me providing the "path" or "map" for anyone who is curious about programming. Something that I'd wish I had when I started out, back in early 2016. 

Now it's here. It's simple as ever. It's open sourced. 

It's for You.

**It's a free course. Where I plan on taking you from wherever you stand in terms of programming, even if it seems a mystical art where only select mathematicians get to work with something called algorithms, to an employable level. I will break things down as simple as possible and provide context, as well as focus on the practical side.**

## Cool, so why free? *Where's the hook*?

No hook. Pure conditionless value, for whoever thinks they can or cannot do it. With this material being available, nobody can tell me that it's *"impossible"* for them. Honestly, if this helps atleast one person, who makes it known to me - then I have already retrieved the value I wanted, everything that follows after is just a bonus.

It's a **passion** project, because I self-learned this thing. I'd like to express my deepest gratitude towards anyone's material I have consumed and learned from over the course of the last few years. 

Almost all of the material that I used is out there on the internet is available free of charge. Be it blogs, tutorials, videos, course sites, documentation, books and etc. I have spent a ton of time going through them, now I am compiling it into a contextualized, practical handbook or the way I like to think about it - **a map**.

## What to expect?

I will create posts and group them into topics. I will start from the basics and work all the way up to building up a portfolio and (hopefully) beyond! In addition, I will supply content like videos, code snippets, slides for reference and more!
